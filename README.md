# MozillaBug
This is just a fix for a bug.
For dark themes in linux, Firefox has a light grey text on a white background.
1. To fix this, you have to create a folder in ~/.mozilla/firefox/somethemefolder.default called chrome
2. Inside the folder you have to create a file named userContent.css
3. The content of this file i will put in the actual file.
4. After doing this, you have to copy the chrome folder inside all the theme folders of firefox.
5. Restart Firefox.
